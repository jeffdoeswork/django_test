Django App:
    crm
        _init_.py
        settings.py     (This is the main config to the app: Such as Apps and Databases)
        urls.py         (Directs routs paths to templplates, by returning functions)
        wsgi.py

     >accounts
    >Migrations    (folder)
    _init_.py
    admin.py        (Main thing to focus on)
    apps.py
    models.py       (where we buld Database and Class objects)
    tests.py
    views.py        (Classes that URL patters render templplates, you can querey database stuff here so you can call it in your html files using {%  %} )  

Commands:

django-admin startproject crm (builds project)

python manage.py runserver (starts server)

python manage.py migrate   (conifgures Database)

python manage.py shell                      (opens django shell kinda like a python or flask shell)
from accounts.models import *                   (imports all the models (database))
customers = Customer.objects.all()              (makes a variable thats a dictonary of the Customer database table)
